This was all included in the <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30708/warhammer-40000-compendium">Warhammer 40k Compendium</a>. The highlight of the article is definitely the suggestion of Ogryns being able to ride to battle in a converted open top Rhino, which is something I wouldn't mind seeing in action, right up to the point said Ogryns were deployed in the midst of my troops!
