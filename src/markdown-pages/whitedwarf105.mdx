p10 - Critical Mass: A rather dissatisfied CM covers the latest sci-fi releases. Includes a Philip K. Dick offering for kids (could have done with a bit of polishing!) and a 2 volume offering, <ExternalLink externalLinkHref="http://astore.amazon.co.uk/whitelibrary-21/detail/B00070ZNY6" externalLinkTitle="The Wave and the Flame and Reign of Fire" />, from Marjorie Bradley Kellogg which was well received.
