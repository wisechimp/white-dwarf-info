p32 - Terminator Armour: An introduction to Terminators featuring some very old school armour versions. Curiously this article was effectively replaced by an updated version in <Link to="/issues/white-dwarf-magazine-112">White Dwarf 112</Link> only 3 months later, which was the version that found it's way into the W40k Compendium rather than this one.
